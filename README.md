Purpose
-------
This repository contains labs and assigments that I was tasked to complete in my Web programming course.

Favorite assigment
------------------
My favorite assignment is the mbta. Here I got to write a lot of code and helped better grasp some important concerpts in Javascript and also learn it's syntax and semantics at the same time.

Progress
--------
The growth I have made in this course has been tremendous. I started this course dreading front end but finishing the course I have found myself appreciating it more. I am now familiar with a lot of topics in front end design that I didn't even know about and think about things like security when engineering good designs

Most important lesson
---------------------
The most important lesson I have learnt from this course is that the most amount of learning happens outside the classroom and as a result, responsible for my own learning. For the project I had to really understand how the server side of things operated to be able to implement the logic necessary for keeping track of user data. Also for the mbta assigment I had to learn and understand how the API for mbta schedule functioned.

Interests
---------
Now that I now have a somewhat good foundation in JS I want to start learning a front-end frame like React or AngularJS.
