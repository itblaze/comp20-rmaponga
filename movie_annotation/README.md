Movie annotation lab
--------------------

The lab was aimed at developing skills in javascript and interacting with DOM elements. The goal was to annotate a video with correct subtitles as the video was playing. 

All parts of this assignment were implemented correctly with the javascript code being able to annotate the video within reasonable time percentage error.

Spent 2 and a half hours working on this assignment.
